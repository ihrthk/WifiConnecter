WifiConnecter

=============

A android library that allows you to connect to a Wi-Fi hotspot with the given ssid and password.

This library is very easy to use:

    	    WiFiConnecter mWiFiConnecter = new WiFiConnecter(mContext);
		    mWiFiConnecter.connect("ssid", "password", new WiFiConnecter.ActionListener() {
			@Override
			public void onStart() {
			}

			@Override
			public void onSuccess() {
			}

			@Override
			public void onFailure() {
			}

			@Override
			public void onFinished() {
			}

		});
